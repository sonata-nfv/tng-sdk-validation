# Validation tool

This repository contains the `tng-sdk-validation` component that is part of the European H2020 project [5GTANGO](http://www.5gtango.eu) NFV SDK. This component can be used to validate the syntax, integrity and topology of 5GTANGO file descriptors. Besides, `tng-sdk-validation` can be used through the CLI, as service  or as a micro-service running inside a docker container.

# Dependencies

This tool has been designed to be executed in Linux system and Python 3.6 or higher. In addition, it is necessary to have installed the [tng-sdk-project](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-project) before starting.

Other requirements are specified [here](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-validation/blob/master/requirements.txt). They can be installed with the following statement:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

# Installation
## Automated

It is possible to use the following command for automatic installation

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-validation.git
```

## Manual
Manual installation is possible with:

```
git clone git@github.com:sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-validation.git
cd tng-sdk-validation
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

## Hint
It is a good practice to first create a new virtual environment in which all 5GTANGO SDK tools can be installed. You can do this as follows:

```
# get the path to your Python3 installation
which python3

# create a new virtualenv
virtualenv -p <path/to/python3> venv

# activate the virtualenv
source venv/bin/activate
```

# Usage

The validator can either be used as a command line tool (CLI mode) or as a micro service which offers a REST API.

## CLI mode

Runs the validator locally from the command line. Details about all possible parameters can be shown using:

```
tng-sdk-validate -h
```

More details on the usage and some examples of the validator can be found on the [wiki](https://github.com/sonata-nfv/tng-sdk-validation/wiki).

## Service mode

Runs the validator as a service that exposes a REST API:

```
tng-sdk-validate --api
```

### Running dependencies
Validator running as a service needs a **redis BSD** listening in port **6379** to perform the validation. Therefore:

```
#installation of redis server
apt-get install redis-server

#redis server listening in port 6379
redis-server --port 6379
```

## Docker-based service

```
#create the docker image
docker build --no-cache -f ./Dockerfile -t registry.sonata-nfv.eu:5000/tng-sdk-validation .

#run the image
docker run --rm -d --name tng-sdk-validate registry.sonata-nfv.eu:5000/tng-sdk-validation
```

# Development
